**When to update:**
- During heartbeats: review recent daily logs and extract what's worth keeping
- After significant events
- When you learn something important

**What NOT to include:**
- Secrets or sensitive data (unless explicitly told to remember)
- Details that belong in USER.md or TOOLS.md instead
- Temporary context (use daily logs for that)

**Security:**
- ONLY load in main session (direct chats with your human)
- DO NOT load in shared contexts (Discord, group chats, sessions with other people)
