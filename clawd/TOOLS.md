# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

> ✏️ CUSTOM - 此文件由 Team 自定义

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- API endpoints and credentials references
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Channel IDs and names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Slack Channels
- #team-alerts → C0XXXXXX (escalation)
- #daily-standup → C0YYYYYY

### Discord
- Guild ID: 1234567890
- Support Channel: 9876543210

### APIs
- Jira: credentials in .secrets.json
- GitHub: use personal access token

### SSH
- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
